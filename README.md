# What is it?
Racoon MC Modpack Installer is a very light script that installs a Minecraft modpack either via a direct link (ending with .zip) or from a .html file (that you get in the modpack folder).
<br> It requires just TWO libraries + a version of Python 3 (untested on Python 2).

# Creators

The project was started by Marcin Jacek Chmiel on March 16th, 2025. Right now, there are no other contributors.

# How to use

1. Choose an installation method when prompted. # It is better to install from .html file
2. Follow on-screen instructions
3. Done!
